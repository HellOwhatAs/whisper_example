You go in there, you have a fight, and that's it. You get out of there, you get paid. The good thing is, I've got paid, I'm going home to my family, and we go on to the next Thunder's beauty fight. So, happy days. There is no excuses. You're in there on the night, I've done the best I could, that's it. There's no excuses. Oh, I didn't perform well because I didn't time your shoelaces in a certain manner. Listen, it was what it was. It was a tough fight. It was a good game, man, and that was it. There was nothing else I can say about it. He was a good fellow, and I've done my best, and that was it. I won the fight, and out we go on to the next one. I've been paid, been laid, and we go home now. That's it.",
